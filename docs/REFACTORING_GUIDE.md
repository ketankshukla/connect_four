# Connect Four - Refactoring Guide

This guide documents the refactoring process applied to the Connect Four game to improve its architecture, organization, and performance.

## Refactoring Goals

The refactoring aimed to achieve the following goals:

1. **Improved Code Organization**: Split monolithic files into smaller, more focused modules
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Ensure each module has a clear, single responsibility
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Make the codebase easier to understand and modify
4. **Optimized Performance**: Improve code efficiency where possible
5. **Preserved Functionality**: Maintain all existing features and behavior

## Backend Refactoring

The original backend consisted of a single `index.py` file containing all game logic, AI algorithms, and API endpoints. This was refactored into a modular structure:

### New Backend Structure

```
connect_four/
├── game_logic.py        # Core game mechanics and state management
├── ai_engine.py         # AI logic and minimax algorithm
├── api_routes.py        # Flask API endpoints
├── app.py               # Application factory
└── index.py             # Entry point for Vercel compatibility
```

### Module Responsibilities

1. **game_logic.py**
   - Contains the `GameState` class that encapsulates the game state and core mechanics
   - Handles board representation, move validation, and win detection
   - Provides methods for state manipulation and retrieval

2. **ai_engine.py**
   - Contains the `AIEngine` class for computer player decision-making
   - Implements the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
   - Provides methods for board evaluation and move selection

3. **api_routes.py**
   - Defines a Flask Blueprint with all API endpoints
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Connects the frontend with the game logic and AI engine

4. **app.py**
   - Contains the application factory function `create_app()`
   - Configures the Flask application
   - Registers routes and initializes components

5. **index.py**
   - Serves as the entry point for Vercel deployment
   - Imports and runs the application created by `app.py`

### Key Improvements

- **Encapsulation**: Game state is now properly encapsulated in a class
- **Dependency Injection**: Components are connected through clear interfaces
- **Reduced Global State**: Eliminated global variables in favor of class properties
- **Simplified Testing**: Each module can be tested independently

## Frontend Refactoring

The original frontend consisted of a single `script.js` file containing all UI logic, event handling, and API communication. This was refactored into ES6 modules:

### New Frontend Structure

```
connect_four/public/
├── js/
│   ├── api-client.js     # API communication
│   ├── game-state.js     # Game state management
│   ├── board.js          # Board rendering and UI
│   ├── ui-controller.js  # UI event handling
│   └── main.js           # Application entry point
├── index.html            # Updated to use ES modules
├── style.css             # Unchanged
└── script.js             # Compatibility layer
```

### Module Responsibilities

1. **api-client.js**
   - Handles all communication with the backend API
   - Provides methods for fetching game state, making moves, and resetting the game
   - Encapsulates fetch API calls and error handling

2. **game-state.js**
   - Manages the client-side game state
   - Provides methods to update and query the state
   - Converts between different state representations

3. **board.js**
   - Handles the rendering and visual aspects of the game board
   - Updates the DOM based on game state changes
   - Manages visual effects and animations

4. **ui-controller.js**
   - Manages user interactions and game flow
   - Connects user actions to game state changes
   - Coordinates between different modules

5. **main.js**
   - Entry point that initializes all modules
   - Sets up event listeners and dependencies

6. **script.js**
   - Compatibility layer for backward compatibility
   - Redirects to the new modular structure

### Key Improvements

- **Modularity**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other projects
- **Modern JavaScript**: Uses ES6 modules for better organization
- **Backward Compatibility**: Original script.js provides a fallback mechanism

## HTML Changes

The `index.html` file was updated to use the new modular JavaScript structure:

```html
<!-- Before -->
<script src="/script.js"></script>

<!-- After -->
<script type="module" src="/js/main.js"></script>
```

## Testing the Refactored Application

To test the refactored application:

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```powershell
   python index.py
   ```

3. Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## Deployment Considerations

The refactored application maintains compatibility with Vercel deployment:

- The `index.py` file remains the entry point
- The `vercel.json` configuration is unchanged
- Static files are still served from the `public` directory

## Future Improvements

The refactored architecture makes it easier to implement future improvements:

1. **Unit Testing**: Add unit tests for each module
2. **Additional Game Modes**: Implement new game modes like two-player
3. **Difficulty Levels**: Add multiple AI difficulty levels
4. **Persistent Storage**: Add game state saving and loading
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Further optimize the AI algorithm

## Conclusion

The refactoring has successfully transformed the Connect Four game from a monolithic application to a modular, maintainable codebase while preserving all functionality. The new architecture follows best practices for both Python and JavaScript development, making it easier to understand, modify, and extend the game in the future.
